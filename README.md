# Hidden Tools

A bunch of tools to help people in the Solana ecosystem. This website includes:
- a UI to burn Solana NFTs
- a UI to burn SPL-tokens
- a UI to close empty accounts
- a multi sender (a UI to send multiple tokens in 1 transaction (same token to different people/many tokens to one person/transfer solana domain name)
- a UI to send a NFT message to the owner of your desired NFT or solana domain name

This is a fork from https://github.com/cryptoloutre/solana-tools customised to fit my project's theme.
